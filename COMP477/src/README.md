### Codebase for COMP447 ###

Hi, Juan. 

This is the code base of COMP447, what I have done in the codebase are:

* Loading skeleton file
* Loading mesh and display
* Picking

I haven't change the joints to their names in skeleton file since I found it's easier to keep the datastructure this way.

==Classes==

There are mainly two classes here in the code.

* Skeleton

* defMesh

There is a skeleton object in defMesh class.
